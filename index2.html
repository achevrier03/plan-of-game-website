    <p class="tip1"><b>Tips for best controller settings:</b></p>
</div>

<p class="tipinfo1">Having your contoller setting set to this, Should help improve your aiming.</p>
<div><p class="I1"> <b style="color:MediumSeaGreen;"> Look Acceleration and Sensitivity:</b> The new controls should help you to quickly aim but still have moderate aiming sensitivity so you wont be thrown off.</p></div>
<br><div><p class="I2"> <b style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">Zoom Sensitivity:</b> Its fine to keep these settings at the default value since you dont want to over aim while zooming. <br> But if you can aim and shoot real quick, then increase the sensitivity as you see fit and lower it down if you have a hard time aiming.</p></div>
<br><div><p class="I3"> <b style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">Move Thumbstick:</b> You will be able to experience the best responsiveness with these settings due to the lack of deadzones. <br>You can rapidly reach your maximum movement speed with the default maximum input threshold, but it also slows down quickly. But, if your thumbstick drifts, experiment with the axial and centre deadzones. While your hands are off the controller, increase them till your Spartan doesn't move at all.</p></div>
<br><div><p class="I4"> <b style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">Look Thumbstick</b> The glance thumbstick's settings make it feasible for you to enter data as soon as possible. <br>You have complete control over your aim thanks to the maximum input threshold of 15. Raise the deadzone numbers once more if your controller exhibits critical thumbstick drift. Then set the axial deadzone to 0.5 and the centre deadzone to 1.</p></div>

<p class="ins1"> The object of the game is for  Players to battle aliens as they attempt to uncover the secrets of the eponymous Halo, a ring-shaped artificial world. You, the player are assuming the role of the Master Chief, a cybernetically enhanced supersoldier. Who is accompanied by Cortana, an artificial intelligence.</p>
<br>
<p class="ins2"> In Halo: Combat Evolved, a 3D world, first-person gameplay is the main gameplay experience for gamers. Moving around allows the user to look up, down, left, or right. The user can control many of the cars that are included in the game. For pilots and mounted gun operators, the game transitions to a third-person viewpoint while passengers continue to see things in first person.</p>
<br> 
<p class="ins3">The player character is equipped with an energy shield that nullifies damage from weapons fire and forceful impacts.The shield's charge appears as a blue bar in the corner of the game's heads-up display, and it automatically recharges if no damage is sustained for a brief period. The player's vulnerability increases until the shield is completely gone, and additional damage lowers their health meter's hit points. The character dies and the game restarts from a previously saved checkpoint when this health metre reaches zero. The game's levels contain health packets that can be collected to restore lost health.</p>
